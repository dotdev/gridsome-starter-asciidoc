Here are some examples of code blocks.

=== Includes

In fact, the code block examples where loaded from an external asciidoc file. +
And the <<faithfull_table>> table is generated by loading external csv data.

== Admonitions

TIP: You can add line numbers to source listings by adding the word `numbered` in the attribute list after the language name.

== Tables

A basic table with a cell spanning two rows

.Table where a cell spans two rows
|===

|Cell in column 1, row 1 |Cell in column 2, row 1 |Cell in column 3, row 1

.2+|Content in a single cell that spans rows 2 and 3
|Cell in column 2, row 2
|Cell in column 3, row 2

|Cell in column 2, row 3
|Cell in column 3, row 3

|===

Tables can have other types of blocks contained in their cells.

.Cells with source code listing
|===
|Source Code 1 |Source Code 2

import os
print "%s" %(os.uname())

Next is a table showing the Old Faithful geyser: index, time between eruptions, and length of eruption. 272 records
(only showing the first 10), each with three values. There is also an initial header line.

== Images

This asciidoc transformer -unlike the markdown one- doesn't currently support transformations or lazy loading of images.
Nor does it add images using a file resolver. Images must be placed in the static folder of gridsome so they can be
included in the build output.

A global asciidoc attribute can be specified to set the root directory of the images, to make the links in each document
shorter.

In the following example (and this site), static images are located in the directory `$GridsomeRoot/static/assets/img/` +
Asciidoc documents can reference images relative to this path, if the `imagesdir` attribute is set correctly.

.gridsome.config.js
[source, js]
----
module.exports = {
  transformers: {
    asciidoc: {
      attributes: {
        imagesdir: '/assets/img',
      }
    }
  }
}
----

Images can be loaded from external sources ...
